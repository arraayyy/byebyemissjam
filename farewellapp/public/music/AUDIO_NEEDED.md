# Audio File Needed

The file `newyears.mp3` needs to be placed in this directory for Roe's section audio to work properly.

The code in `MemoriesGallery.tsx` is already configured to use this file when `friend === 'roe'`.

## Implementation Status
- ✅ Video functionality added (stickman.mp4 plays before letter)
- ✅ Transition from video to letter content implemented  
- ⏳ Audio file `newyears.mp3` needs to be added to `/public/music/`

## How it works
1. When Roe section is selected, the stickman.mp4 video plays first
2. After video ends, it transitions to show the letter content
3. Audio should loop newyears.mp3 instead of nostalgic-track.mp3
